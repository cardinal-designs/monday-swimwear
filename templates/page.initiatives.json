        "text": "We’ve been really lucky to have a brand that continues to grow each year. With that attention and success, it’s important for us to give back and we’re committed to making an impact. The most attention and excitement comes whenever we release a new collection so we decided to start using that to bring awareness to the causes and foundations that are important to us by pairing them with collections we know you guys will love. \n<br><br>\nSo far we’ve focused our efforts on three main pillars: conservation, women’s health, and access to mental health care. We’re dedicated to highlighting and contributing to at least two charities in our main Summer and Resort seasons along with continuing our community outreach like we have in the past by donating meals to essential healthcare workers or contributing to wildfire funds. Learn about the charities we’re grateful to support below."
